            <h3 class="blog-textQuestion">Q1. Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
            <p class="blog-text">
                <b>Answer:</b> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in
                localStorage
                doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
                localStorage - stores data with no expiration date. window. sessionStorage - stores data for one session
                (data is lost when the browser tab is closed).
                If your application needs data to be shared across multiple browser windows and tabs, use the
                LocalStorage otherwise, use the SessionStorage. Both SessionStorage and LocalStorage are vulnerable to
                XSS attacks. Therefore avoid storing sensitive data in browser storage.

            <h3 class="blog-textQuestion">Q2. Difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
            <p class="blog-text">
                <b>Answer:</b> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can
                be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                <br>
                where, block scope means that the variable defined within a block will not
                be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable
                will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function.

            <h3 class="blog-textQuestion">Q3. How JavaScript Event loop works?</h3>
            <p class="blog-text">
                <b>Answer:</b> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If
                the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                <b>Answer:</b> There are many reason why we get undefined in JavaScript. they are,

                <li>If variables not initialize</li>
                <li>If we don't console or return value from function</li>
                <li>If we don't set any specific parameter</li>
                <li>If return has no value</li>
                <li>If any property not exist in an object</li>
                <li>If we trying to access an array element outside of range</li>
                <li>If we deleting an element from an array</li>
